Great question! You **can** make Microsoft Teams alerts interactive — for example, adding buttons that let users **acknowledge, dismiss, or trigger actions in your web app** — but there are **important limitations** with **Incoming Webhooks**, and you’ll need to **upgrade to a Bot** for full interactivity.

---

### ❌ Limitation of Incoming Webhooks
- **No interactive buttons** (like "Acknowledge", "Fix Now") that trigger backend actions.
- You **cannot** capture button clicks or respond dynamically.
- Supports only static messages (Office 365 Connector Cards), which have limited interactivity (e.g., links, but not POST actions).

---

### ✅ Solution: Use a **Microsoft Teams Bot** with Adaptive Cards

To enable **clickable buttons that trigger actions in your web app**, you need:

1. A **Teams Bot** registered in Azure (via [Microsoft Developer Portal](https://dev.botframework.com/)).
2. An **HTTPS endpoint** in your Python backend to receive button click events.
3. **Adaptive Cards** with `Action.Submit` buttons to send data back to your bot.
4. (Optional) Use the **Bot Framework SDK** or plain HTTP handling.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Interactive Alerts with Buttons

### 1. **Register a Bot in Azure**

1. Go to: [https://dev.botframework.com](https://dev.botframework.com)
2. Register a new bot:
   - Name: e.g., `AlertBot`
   - Messaging endpoint: `https://yourapp.com/api/teams/messages` (must be HTTPS)
   - Copy the **App ID** and **App Password** (keep them secure).
3. Enable **Microsoft Teams** as a channel.

> 🔐 You’ll need a **public HTTPS URL** (use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for local testing).

---

### 2. **Send an Adaptive Card with a Button**

Once your bot is set up, send an Adaptive Card to a Teams channel or user (via Graph API or Bot conversation). Example card with a button:

```json
{
  "type": "message",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "contentType": "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
      "content": {
        "type": "AdaptiveCard",
        "version": "1.2",
        "body": [
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "🚨 High Severity Alert",
            "weight": "Bolder",
            "size": "Medium"
          },
          {
            "type": "TextBlock",
            "text": "Database is down. Take action?"
          }
        ],
        "actions": [
          {
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "Acknowledge",
            "data": {
              "action": "acknowledge",
              "alertId": "12345",
              "trigger": "user_click"
            }
          },
          {
            "type": "Action.Submit",
            "title": "Restart Service",
            "data": {
              "action": "restart",
              "alertId": "12345"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

> 💡 When a user clicks a button, Teams sends a `POST` to your bot’s message endpoint with the `data` payload.

---

### 3. **Handle Button Clicks in Your Python Backend**

Your backend must receive and process the incoming action:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/api/teams/messages", methods=["POST"])
def teams_callback():
    data = request.json

    # Extract the action data from the card button
    if "value" in data:  # This is from Action.Submit
        action_data = data["value"]  # e.g., {"action": "acknowledge", "alertId": "12345"}
        user = data["from"]["user"]["displayName"]

        print(f"User {user} triggered action: {action_data}")

        # Call your internal logic
        if action_data["action"] == "acknowledge":
            acknowledge_alert(action_data["alertId"], user)
        elif action_data["action"] == "restart":
            trigger_restart_service(action_data["alertId"])

        # Optional: Send a response back to the chat
        return jsonify({
            "type": "message",
            "text": f"✅ {user} acknowledged and action '{action_data['action']}' executed."
        })

    return jsonify({"type": "message", "text": "Received."})

def acknowledge_alert(alert_id, user):
    # Update DB, notify, etc.
    pass

def trigger_restart_service(alert_id):
    # Call internal API, restart service, etc.
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(ssl_context='adhoc')  # HTTPS required
```

---

### 4. **Send the Alert from Your Backend**

To send the Adaptive Card, you need to:

- Use **Microsoft Graph API** to post to a Teams channel, or
- Use the **Bot Framework SDK** to proactively message a user/channel.

#### Example: Proactive Message via Bot Framework (using `botbuilder`)

Install:
```bash
pip install botbuilder-core botbuilder-schema
```

Then use the Bot Framework to send the card (requires auth with App ID/password).

> See: [Proactive messaging docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-proactive-message)

---

### 🔁 Alternative: Simpler "Link Button" (No Bot Needed)

If you **don’t want to set up a bot**, you can still add **clickable links** in your **Incoming Webhook** message that open your web app:

```json
{
  "title": "Alert: Server Down",
  "text": "Database server is unreachable.",
  "potentialAction": [
    {
      "@type": "OpenUri",
      "name": "View in Dashboard",
      "targets": [
        { "os": "default", "uri": "https://yourapp.com/alerts/12345" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "@type": "HttpPOST",
      "name": "Acknowledge (Not Supported in Webhooks!)",
      "target": "https://yourapp.com/api/ack"  // ❌ This won't work in Incoming Webhooks!
    }
  ]
}
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: `HttpPOST` actions **do not work** with Incoming Webhooks. Only `OpenUri`, `ViewAction`, and `SendMessage` are supported — and even those are inconsistently supported.

---

### ✅ Recommendation Summary

| Goal | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Simple alerts (text only) | ✅ Incoming Webhook |
| Buttons that open your web app | ✅ Use `OpenUri` in Connector Card |
| **Buttons that trigger backend actions** | ❌ Not possible with webhooks → ✅ **Use a Bot + Adaptive Cards** |
| Send to private chats | ✅ Requires Bot |
| Full interactivity (forms, dialogs) | ✅ Bot + Adaptive Cards |

---

### 🔧 Quick Start for You

1. Use **ngrok** to expose your local dev server:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   # Get https://abc123.ngrok.io
   ```

2. Set up a **Teams Bot** at [https://dev.botframework.com](https://dev.botframework.com)

3. Implement the `/api/teams/messages` endpoint in your Python app.

4. Send an Adaptive Card with `Action.Submit` buttons.

5. Handle the POST in your backend → trigger actions in your web app.
