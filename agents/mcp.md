# Proposal: MCP Server for OpenShift

## Overview

We propose the development of a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for **Red Hat OpenShift**, enabling Large Language Model (LLM) applications to interact programmatically with OpenShift resources using the standardized MCP interface.

This integration will allow secure, contextual, and dynamic access to OpenShift's data and operations from any compliant LLM system, dramatically expanding automation capabilities and making platform insights available through natural language interfaces.

## Supported Resources

The MCP server will expose the following OpenShift-native resources through the MCP `resources` interface:

| MCP Resource Name         | Maps To OpenShift Resource           | Description |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| `projects`               | `Project`                            | List available projects and their metadata |
| `pods`                   | `Pod`                                | Pod status, container details, and lifecycle events |
| `deployments`            |  `Deployment`                        | Deployment status, replicas, and rollout history |
| `services`               | `Service`                            | Service details including type and endpoint mappings |
| `routes`                 | `Route`                              | Route exposure and public URL information |
| `events`                 | `Event`                              | Real-time cluster event stream and filtering |
| `persistentVolumes`      | `PersistentVolume`                   | Cluster-wide volume definitions |
| `persistentVolumeClaims` | `PersistentVolumeClaim`              | Volume claims associated with applications |

## Authentication

The MCP server will support two types of authentication to enable secure and flexible access:

### 1. Token-Based Authentication

- Uses OpenShift OAuth tokens (e.g., `oc whoami -t`).
- Ideal for automated systems or integrations with CI/CD platforms.
- Tokens will be validated via the OpenShift API.

### 2. Username/Password Authentication

- Uses basic auth against OpenShift's OAuth proxy.
- Suitable for interactive or development use.
- Username/password will be exchanged for a session token with appropriate role bindings.

> Authentication mechanisms will be configurable via environment variables or secrets.

## Technology Stack

| Component           | Technology                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| MCP Python SDK     | [modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) |
| OpenShift Rest Client | [openshift-restclient-python](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-restclient-python) |

## Future Enhancements

- Support for `tools` and `prompts` interfaces to allow mutation operations like scaling, restarting, or deploying apps.
