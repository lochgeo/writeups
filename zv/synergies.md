## Synergies

### Does your centre have policies, practices or synergies to ease collaboration with start-ups?
Yes, our global capability center recognizes the importance of collaborating with startups as a means of fostering innovation and staying at the forefront of emerging technologies and disruptive solutions. We have implemented several policies, practices, and initiatives to facilitate seamless collaboration with startups. Here are some key elements:

1. Startup Engagement Program:
   We have established a dedicated Startup Engagement Program that serves as a gateway for startups to connect with our organization. This program provides a structured framework for identifying promising startups, evaluating their solutions, and exploring potential collaboration opportunities. It involves conducting regular startup scouting activities, participating in industry events, and maintaining an active network within the startup ecosystem.

2. Startup Accelerator and Incubation Support:
   We offer support and resources to promising startups through our in-house accelerator and incubation programs. Selected startups gain access to our infrastructure, mentorship from subject matter experts, and guidance on various aspects of business development, such as product design, go-to-market strategies, and scaling operations. This support helps startups refine their solutions and navigate the challenges of growth.

3. Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Collaborations:
   We actively engage with startups to conduct proof-of-concept (PoC) collaborations, where we pilot and evaluate their innovative solutions within our operational environment. These PoC collaborations provide startups with real-world testing grounds and valuable feedback, while allowing us to assess the potential impact and viability of their offerings before committing to larger-scale deployments.

4. Co-innovation and Joint Development:
   In cases where a startup's solution aligns with our strategic objectives, we pursue co-innovation and joint development initiatives. These collaborations involve our teams working closely with the startup's engineers and developers to co-create new products, services, or technologies. By combining our respective expertise and resources, we can accelerate innovation and bring cutting-edge solutions to market more efficiently.

5. Startup Investment Fund:
   We have established a dedicated investment fund specifically aimed at supporting promising startups in our areas of interest. This fund enables us to make strategic investments in startups, fostering long-term partnerships and facilitating the development and commercialization of innovative solutions that can benefit our organization and the broader industry.

6. Startup Mentorship and Knowledge Sharing:
   Our subject matter experts and experienced professionals actively engage in mentorship and knowledge-sharing initiatives with startups. We organize regular workshops, seminars, and networking events where our employees share their expertise and insights, helping startups navigate challenges, refine their offerings, and gain industry-specific knowledge.

7. Startup-focused Innovation Challenges:
   We organize startup-focused innovation challenges, inviting startups to propose innovative solutions to specific business challenges or opportunities. These challenges provide a platform for startups to showcase their capabilities, gain exposure, and potentially secure partnerships or pilot projects with our organization.

By implementing these policies, practices, and initiatives, we foster an environment that encourages collaboration with startups, facilitating the exchange of ideas, expertise, and resources. This approach enables us to tap into the vibrant startup ecosystem, gain access to cutting-edge innovations, and drive our own innovation agenda while supporting the growth and success of promising startups.
