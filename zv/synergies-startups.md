   Our subject matter experts and experienced professionals actively engage in mentorship and knowledge-sharing initiatives with startups. We organize regular workshops, seminars, and networking events where our employees share their expertise and insights, helping startups navigate challenges, refine their offerings, and gain industry-specific knowledge.

7. Startup-focused Innovation Challenges:
   We organize startup-focused innovation challenges, inviting startups to propose innovative solutions to specific business challenges or opportunities. These challenges provide a platform for startups to showcase their capabilities, gain exposure, and potentially secure partnerships or pilot projects with our organization.

By implementing these policies, practices, and initiatives, we foster an environment that encourages collaboration with startups, facilitating the exchange of ideas, expertise, and resources. This approach enables us to tap into the vibrant startup ecosystem, gain access to cutting-edge innovations, and drive our own innovation agenda while supporting the growth and success of promising startups.
