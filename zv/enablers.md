Innovation Time Off: We offer dedicated "Innovation Time Off" for employees, where they can take a certain number of paid days or hours per year to work on personal innovation projects or explore new concepts related to their work. This policy encourages employees to step away from their regular duties and dedicate focused time to creative thinking and experimentation.
5. Innovation Mentorship and Training Programs: We have established mentorship programs and training initiatives to help employees develop their innovation skills and mindsets. These programs provide guidance on design thinking, problem-solving techniques, prototyping, and other relevant methodologies to support the innovation process.
