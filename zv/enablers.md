### Does your centre have any policies to ease employee participation in innovation activities?
Yes, at our global capability center in India, we have implemented several policies and initiatives to encourage and facilitate employee participation in innovation activities. We recognize that fostering an innovative culture and leveraging the creativity and diverse perspectives of our workforce is crucial for driving impactful innovations. Here are some of the key policies and programs we have in place:

1. Intrapreneurship Program: We have established an Intrapreneurship Program that empowers employees to work on their innovative product ideas or process improvements. Employees can pitch their ideas and, if selected, receive dedicated funding, mentorship, and resources to develop and prototype their concepts. This program not only encourages entrepreneurial thinking but also creates a sense of ownership and commitment to innovation.

2. Innovation Challenges and Hackathons: We regularly organize internal innovation challenges and hackathons, where employees from different departments and backgrounds come together to collaborate and develop innovative solutions for specific business challenges or opportunities. These events foster cross-functional collaboration, promote creative thinking, and provide a platform for employees to showcase their skills and ideas.

3. Ideation Platforms and Suggestion Schemes: We have implemented digital ideation platforms and suggestion schemes that allow employees to submit their innovative ideas and proposals. These platforms provide a streamlined process for idea evaluation, feedback, and potential implementation. Employees who contribute valuable ideas are recognized and rewarded, further incentivizing participation in innovation activities.

4. Innovation Time Off: We offer dedicated "Innovation Time Off" for employees, where they can take a certain number of paid days or hours per year to work on personal innovation projects or explore new concepts related to their work. This policy encourages employees to step away from their regular duties and dedicate focused time to creative thinking and experimentation.

5. Innovation Mentorship and Training Programs: We have established mentorship programs and training initiatives to help employees develop their innovation skills and mindsets. These programs provide guidance on design thinking, problem-solving techniques, prototyping, and other relevant methodologies to support the innovation process.

6. Collaboration Spaces and Innovation Labs: We have created dedicated collaboration spaces and innovation labs within our facilities, designed to foster creativity and experimentation. These spaces are equipped with the necessary tools, technologies, and resources to facilitate hands-on exploration, prototyping, and testing of innovative ideas.

7. Innovation Awards and Recognition: We have implemented an innovation awards and recognition program to celebrate and acknowledge employees who have made significant contributions to our innovation initiatives. This recognition not only motivates and encourages further participation but also helps to promote a culture of innovation and highlight role models within the organization.

By implementing these policies and programs, we aim to create an environment that encourages employee participation, nurtures creativity, and fosters a sense of ownership and commitment to innovation. Engaging our talented workforce and leveraging their diverse perspectives and ideas are key to driving sustainable innovation success at our global capability center.
