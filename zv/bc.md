### **Slide 1: Business Case for Centralized Migration Team**

**Objective:**  
Accelerate and standardize the migration of 35 applications to Kubernetes, transitioning CI/CD pipelines and secrets management by Dec 2025.

**Proposed Solution:**  
Establish a **6-member specialized migration team** to execute migrations up to the **SIT environment**, with app teams responsible for progressing to **UAT** and **Production**.

**Key Deliverables:**  
- **CI Pipeline:** Jenkins → GitHub Actions  
- **CD Pipeline:** UCD → Harness  
- **Secrets Management:** Legacy → HashiCorp Vault  
- **Full Kubernetes Deployment to SIT**  

**Critical Success Factor:**  
**Active collaboration** with app teams is essential for environment validation, custom configurations, and successful handover.

**Benefits:**  
- **Faster Delivery:** Centralized execution minimizes disruption to product teams.  
- **Standardization:** Consistent implementation improves security and compliance.  
- **Expertise Utilization:** Specialists reduce learning curves and errors.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Consolidated effort lowers operational costs.  
- **Greater Automation:** Centralized ownership enables scalable automation across CI/CD, deployment, and secrets management.  
- **Risk Mitigation:** Early detection and resolution of migration bottlenecks.

### **Slide 2: Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

**Potential Risks:**  
- **Resource Overload:** Migration team may face bottlenecks handling 35 apps.  
- **App Team Dependency:** Lack of engagement from app teams could delay handovers.  
- **Knowledge Gap:** Limited app team experience with new tools post-handover.  
- **Integration Challenges:** Custom configurations may not align with standard solutions.  
- **Timeline Slippage:** Complex apps could delay the schedule.  

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- **Phased Rollout:** Prioritize apps by complexity and business impact.  
- **Mandatory Collaboration:** Define clear roles for app teams during SIT handover.  
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Provide self-service guides and handover workshops.  
- **Automation Focus:** Build reusable automation scripts to streamline migrations.  
- **Flex Capacity:** Allocate temporary resources during high-demand phases.  
- **Progress Tracking:** Use milestone-based reviews for on-time delivery.
