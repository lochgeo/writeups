Based on the excerpt from the CFPB personal financial data rights final rule, it appears that the API should return commonly requested terms and conditions as discrete data fields. Some examples of such terms and conditions include:
Applicable APRs (Annual Percentage Rates)
APYs (Annual Percentage Yields)
These terms and conditions are typically shared in third-party interfaces to support comparison shopping and personal account management.
Additionally, the final rule states that the API should make available certain other terms and conditions as discrete data fields, including:
The full account opening agreement
Any applicable disclosures required by law
However, it's worth noting that not all of these terms and conditions need to be made available as separate "callable" data fields. Instead, they can be provided within a broader section of the agreement or by making the full account opening agreement available in a standardized and machine-readable format.
It's also important to note that the API should provide a prompt response to legitimate requests from third parties, including those requesting access to the API or information about the terms and conditions.
