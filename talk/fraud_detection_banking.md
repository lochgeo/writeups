Expanded Slide 4: Evolution of Fraud Detection in Banking
Title: From Rule-Based to AI-Driven Fraud Detection
Key Points:
1. Early Fraud Detection: Rule-Based Systems
How it worked:
Banks set static rules to detect fraud (e.g., flagging transactions over $10,000).
If a transaction violated a rule, it was either blocked or flagged for review.
Limitations:
Easy for fraudsters to bypass (e.g., breaking a large transaction into smaller ones).
High false positives (e.g., a traveler making purchases abroad gets flagged).
No ability to adapt to new fraud tactics.
2. Machine Learning (ML)-Based Fraud Detection
How it improved detection:
ML models analyzed transaction patterns to detect anomalies.
Used supervised learning (training models on historical fraud data).
Could spot more complex fraud patterns than rules-based systems.
Limitations:
Required large labeled datasets (which are often imbalanced).
Could not adapt quickly to new fraud tactics.
Black box problemâ€”banks struggled to explain ML decisions to regulators.
3. Enter Generative AI: A New Paradigm in Fraud Detection
Why Generative AI is different:
Learns from normal transaction behavior and detects anomalies without predefined fraud labels.
Creates synthetic fraudulent transactions to train better detection models.
Generates adversarial fraud patterns (helps improve fraud resistance).
Key Benefits:
Detects subtle fraud behaviors that rule-based and ML models miss.
Can self-improve in real-time, making it harder for fraudsters to adapt.
Reduces false positives, improving customer experience.
