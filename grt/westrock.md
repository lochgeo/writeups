**User:** Profit & Loss

**Assistant:** In the year ended September 30, 2023, the company experienced a decrease in net sales compared to the previous year, with sales totaling \$20,310.0 million in 2023 compared to \$21,256.5 million in 2022. This decline in revenue can be attributed to various factors such as changes in consumer demand, market competition, or economic conditions. The decrease in net sales ultimately impacted the company's gross profit, which decreased from \$4,019.0 million in 2022 to \$3,584.5 million in 2023. This decline in gross profit margin indicates that the company may have faced challenges in managing its cost of goods sold effectively.

Furthermore, the operating profit for the year ended September 30, 2023, showed a significant decrease compared to the previous year. The company reported an operating loss of \$1,511.5 million in 2023, a sharp contrast to the operating profit of \$1,326.8 million in 2022. This decline in operating profit can be attributed to higher restructuring and other costs, impairment of goodwill and mineral rights, as well as lower revenue.

Additionally, the company experienced an increase in interest expenses in 2023, with a net interest expense of \$417.9 million compared to \$318.8 million in 2022. This increase in interest expenses could be due to higher borrowing costs or an increase in the company's debt levels. The higher interest expenses negatively impacted the company's net profit, which resulted in a net loss attributable to common stockholders in 2023.

Lastly, the cash flow from operations may have been affected by the decline in revenue and profitability, leading to lower cash flows in 2023 compared to 2022. This could have implications for the company's ability to fund its operations, investments, and debt obligations. Overall, the company's financial performance in 2023 reflects challenges in revenue generation, cost management, and profitability, which may require strategic adjustments to improve future performance.
