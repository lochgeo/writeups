Executive Summary

I propose hosting a hackathon to encourage developers to create innovative AI agents using LangGraph or ADK (Agent Development Kit). These agents will be integrated into a company-branded agent marketplace, driving innovation, enhancing our product ecosystem, and positioning our organization as a leader in the AI agent economy. This initiative will engage our developer community, attract top talent, and create a scalable, revenue-generating platform.

Why This Hackathon?





Strategic Alignment with AI Trends: AI agents are transforming industries by automating complex workflows and enhancing user experiences. By leveraging LangGraph or ADK, we can empower developers to build agents that are modular, scalable, and customizable, aligning with the growing demand for intelligent automation.



Marketplace Opportunity: An agent marketplace will serve as a centralized platform for users to discover, deploy, and monetize AI agents. This creates a new revenue stream and strengthens our ecosystem by offering value-added services to customers.



Community Engagement and Talent Attraction: A hackathon fosters collaboration and excitement within the developer community, positioning our company as an innovator in AI. It will also attract top-tier talent, including developers and AI enthusiasts, who can contribute to our ecosystem.



Low-Cost, High-Impact Innovation: Hackathons are a cost-effective way to generate proof-of-concepts and prototypes. The agents developed can be rapidly tested and integrated into the marketplace, accelerating our product development cycle.
