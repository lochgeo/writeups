Hey! For a React developer with **3â€“5 years of experience**, youâ€™ll want to test on a mix of **core React concepts**, **modern best practices**, and **real-world problem-solving**. At this level, they should not just know how to build components but also understand **state management**, **performance**, and **app architecture**.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of **topics to test**:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **React Fundamentals**
- JSX, Components (Functional vs Class, though Class is mostly legacy now)
- Props and State
- Lifecycle methods (for Class components) vs `useEffect` in functional components
- Conditional rendering, lists and keys

**Good question:** What happens when you update state directly vs using `setState`?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Hooks**
- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useRef`
- Custom Hooks â€” how and why to write them

**Good question:** When would you use `useMemo` or `useCallback`? Can you give an example?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **State Management**
- Lifting state up
- Context API
- Redux (or alternatives like Zustand, Recoil, Jotai)
- When to choose local state vs global state

**Good question:** How would you manage state across unrelated components?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Component Design & Reusability**
- Controlled vs uncontrolled components
- Composition over inheritance
- Prop drilling and avoiding it
- Compound components pattern

**Good question:** How do you design a reusable form component?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Performance Optimization**
- Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
- React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- Virtualization (e.g., react-window)

**Good question:** A large list renders slowly. How would you optimize that?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Routing**
- React Router (v6+)
- Dynamic routes, nested routes, route guards

**Good question:** How would you implement protected routes?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. **Forms & Validation**
- Controlled inputs, form state
- Libraries like Formik or React Hook Form
- Basic client-side validation

---

### ðŸ”¹ 8. **Testing**
- Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- Mocking, testing async behaviors
- Component vs integration testing

**Good question:** What would you test in a login form?

---

### ðŸ”¹ 9. **TypeScript (if used)**
- Typing props and state
- Type inference and generics
- Discriminated unions for component variants

---

### ðŸ”¹ 10. **Tooling & Ecosystem**
- Vite / Webpack / Create React App
- Linting, Prettier, Husky, ESLint rules
- Component libraries (Material UI, Ant Design, Tailwind CSS)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 11. **API Integration**
- Fetching data with `fetch`, Axios
- Loading states, error handling, cancellation
- `react-query`, `swr` (optional)

---

### ðŸ”¹ 12. **Project Architecture & Best Practices**
- Folder structures
- Separation of concerns (presentational vs container)
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Environment configs

---

### ðŸ”¹ 13. **Soft Skills / Real-World Scenarios**
- Debugging a tricky production bug
- Working in a team / collaborating with backend
- Reviewing code or mentoring juniors

---Absolutely! Here's a set of **10 solid React interview questions** suitable for a **3â€“5 year experienced developer**, along with **model answers** you can use to assess their understanding:

---

### **1. What's the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`? When would you use each?**

**Answer:**  
- `useEffect` runs **after** the DOM has been painted, making it ideal for data fetching, subscriptions, and side effects that don't block the UI.
- `useLayoutEffect` runs **before** the browser paints the screen, making it suitable for DOM measurements or synchronously updating layout styles.
- Use `useLayoutEffect` when a side effect needs to block the paint (e.g., adjusting scroll position based on measurement).

---

### **2. What are some common causes of unnecessary re-renders in React, and how can you prevent them?**

**Answer:**
- Causes:
  - Passing new object/array props
  - State updates that donâ€™t actually change value
  - Not memoizing callbacks/functions
- Prevention:
  - Use `React.memo` for pure functional components
  - Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to memoize functions and values
  - Normalize data and avoid deeply nested state

---

### **3. How do you manage global state in a React application? What are the tradeoffs of different approaches?**

**Answer:**
- Context API â€“ simple, built-in, but causes re-renders for all consumers.
- Redux â€“ powerful and scalable, but adds boilerplate and complexity.
- Zustand / Recoil â€“ simpler and more performant alternatives for medium complexity apps.
- Tradeoff: More powerful tools like Redux are needed when you have complex interdependencies and logic, but simpler tools like Context or Zustand may suffice for small apps.

---

### **4. Explain how the Virtual DOM works in React.**

**Answer:**
- React creates a lightweight copy of the real DOM (Virtual DOM).
- When state/props change, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one (diffing).
- Only the changed elements are updated in the actual DOM (reconciliation).
- This improves performance by reducing direct DOM manipulations.

---

### **5. Whatâ€™s the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?**

**Answer:**
- **Controlled components** have their state managed by React (`value` and `onChange`).
- **Uncontrolled components** use the DOM to manage state (via `ref`).
- Controlled is preferred for form validation and dynamic behavior; uncontrolled may be simpler for simple forms or integrating with non-React code.

---

### **6. How would you implement a reusable `Modal` component in React?**

**Answer:**
- Create a `Modal` component that accepts props like `isOpen`, `onClose`, `children`.
- Use React portals to render the modal outside the main DOM hierarchy.
- Add support for closing on backdrop click or ESC key.
  
*Bonus follow-up:* Ask how they'd handle focus trapping and accessibility (ARIA attributes).

---

### **7. How does `useMemo` work, and when should you not use it?**

**Answer:**
- `useMemo` caches a value and recomputes it only when dependencies change.
- Useful for expensive calculations or preventing unnecessary renders.
- **Don't use it prematurely** â€” it adds complexity and memory overhead if the calculation is cheap.

---

### **8. Whatâ€™s the difference between a presentational and container component?**

**Answer:**
- **Presentational**: Focuses on how things look. Receives props, no state or logic.
- **Container**: Handles data fetching, state, and logic. Passes data to presentational components.
- This separation helps keep components reusable and maintainable.

---

### **9. How would you optimize a large list rendering issue in React?**

**Answer:**
- Use **windowing/virtualization** with libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized`.
- Only render items visible in the viewport.
- Memoize list items with `React.memo` and avoid inline functions/objects.
- Implement lazy loading or pagination if full list isn't needed upfront.

---

### **10. How would you secure a React route that should only be accessible after login?**

**Answer:**
- Use **React Router** to create a `PrivateRoute` component.
- Check for authentication (token, user context).
- Redirect to login if not authenticated.

```jsx
<Route
  path="/dashboard"
  element={isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Navigate to="/login" />}
/>
```
