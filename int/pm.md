### **1. Business Impact & Use Case Clarity**

* **What specific banking problems or customer journeys are you aiming to enhance using generative AI?**
  *(Ensures alignment with real needs and business priorities.)*

* **How do you plan to measure the impact or success of these applications (e.g., productivity gain, customer satisfaction, cost savings)?**
  *(Surfaces how success will be quantified.)*

* **What are the most promising early use cases you’ve identified for generative AI—are they internal or customer-facing?**
  *(Helps prioritize based on feasibility and risk.)*

---

### **2. Technical Architecture & Model Strategy**

* **Are you considering open-source models, commercial APIs (like OpenAI), or training in-house models? What factors drive your choice?**
  *(Reveals trade-offs in cost, control, and IP.)*

* **What is your high-level architecture plan for integrating generative AI into existing banking systems?**
  *(Uncovers awareness of system integration complexity.)*

* **How are you handling prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning to improve model outputs?**
  *(Checks for understanding of model customization techniques.)*

---

### **3. Risk Management, Privacy & Compliance**

* **How are you ensuring that generative AI systems meet regulatory requirements like GDPR, FFIEC, or bank-specific governance policies?**
  *(Tests awareness of legal obligations.)*

* **What safeguards are in place to prevent the generation of harmful, biased, or confidential outputs (e.g., hallucinations or data leaks)?**
  *(Looks at how safety is being built into the design.)*

* **How will you manage and audit the use of customer data in model training, inference, and logging?**
  *(Focuses on data privacy and lifecycle.)*

---

### **4. Operational Oversight & Human-in-the-Loop**

* **What role will human review play in these workflows, especially for high-stakes decisions or customer interactions?**
  *(Explores accountability and risk controls.)*

* **How will you monitor generative AI performance post-deployment, and how frequently will models or prompts be updated?**
  *(Ensures long-term maintainability and relevance.)*

* **Are you planning for fallback mechanisms in case the generative AI fails or provides low-confidence responses?**
  *(Checks for resilience and safety nets.)*

Candidate Feedback – Generative AI Product Manager Role

Overall Recommendation: Proceed to next round

⸻

1. Communication & Attitude
	•	Strengths:
	•	Strong command over English; very articulate and expressive.
	•	Comes across as pleasant, open, and collaborative in conversation.
	•	Demonstrates a clear go-getter attitude and comfort working cross-functionally.

⸻

2. Generative AI Experience
	•	Project Context:
	•	Has been actively involved in implementing a generative AI solution in the onboarding domain—specifically focused on extracting and answering questions from multiple PDF documents.
	•	Project was internal-facing, with no exposure to customer-facing generative AI solutions so far.
	•	Scope of Involvement:
	•	The core generative AI work was outsourced to a vendor. While he didn’t drive the low-level model implementation, he showed a solid grasp of how the solution worked overall.
	•	Has good awareness of concepts like RAG, context windows, fine-tuning, and pre-trained transformers.

⸻

3. Technical & Domain Knowledge
	•	Assessment:
	•	While hands-on technical depth is limited (as expected for a PM role), his understanding of generative AI concepts is adequate and well-aligned with what’s required at this level.
	•	Appreciates the importance of risk, compliance, and guardrails in a regulated banking environment.
	•	Demonstrates an ability to navigate technical discussions and make informed product decisions.

⸻

4. Areas for Follow-Up
	•	Has not worked on customer-facing generative AI applications—next round could assess ability to translate internal experience into external use cases.
	•	Did not get an opportunity to evaluate his roadmap thinking, prioritization, or product strategy skills—suggest covering this in the next interview.

⸻

Conclusion:
The candidate demonstrates strong communication skills, a proactive mindset, and solid conceptual knowledge of generative AI. While vendor reliance limits his hands-on experience, he shows readiness to work at a product level in this domain. Recommend moving him forward to evaluate broader product management competencies.
