### **1. Business Impact & Use Case Clarity**

* **What specific banking problems or customer journeys are you aiming to enhance using generative AI?**
  *(Ensures alignment with real needs and business priorities.)*

* **How do you plan to measure the impact or success of these applications (e.g., productivity gain, customer satisfaction, cost savings)?**
  *(Surfaces how success will be quantified.)*

* **What are the most promising early use cases you’ve identified for generative AI—are they internal or customer-facing?**
  *(Helps prioritize based on feasibility and risk.)*

---

### **2. Technical Architecture & Model Strategy**

* **Are you considering open-source models, commercial APIs (like OpenAI), or training in-house models? What factors drive your choice?**
  *(Reveals trade-offs in cost, control, and IP.)*

* **What is your high-level architecture plan for integrating generative AI into existing banking systems?**
  *(Uncovers awareness of system integration complexity.)*

* **How are you handling prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning to improve model outputs?**
  *(Checks for understanding of model customization techniques.)*

---

### **3. Risk Management, Privacy & Compliance**

* **How are you ensuring that generative AI systems meet regulatory requirements like GDPR, FFIEC, or bank-specific governance policies?**
  *(Tests awareness of legal obligations.)*

* **What safeguards are in place to prevent the generation of harmful, biased, or confidential outputs (e.g., hallucinations or data leaks)?**
  *(Looks at how safety is being built into the design.)*

* **How will you manage and audit the use of customer data in model training, inference, and logging?**
  *(Focuses on data privacy and lifecycle.)*

---

### **4. Operational Oversight & Human-in-the-Loop**

* **What role will human review play in these workflows, especially for high-stakes decisions or customer interactions?**
  *(Explores accountability and risk controls.)*

* **How will you monitor generative AI performance post-deployment, and how frequently will models or prompts be updated?**
  *(Ensures long-term maintainability and relevance.)*

* **Are you planning for fallback mechanisms in case the generative AI fails or provides low-confidence responses?**
  *(Checks for resilience and safety nets.)*
