# AI Chatbot Testing Approach

## Overview
Our generative AI chatbot testing strategy combines manual testing, business validation, and automated evaluation to ensure quality, accuracy, and user satisfaction across all interaction scenarios.

## Manual Testing Strategy

Manual testing focuses on exploratory conversations and structured scenario validation to uncover edge cases and assess response quality. Our QA team conducts unscripted dialogues to discover unexpected behaviors while also executing defined test cases that cover core user journeys. This approach evaluates conversation flow, context retention, factual accuracy, and appropriate handling of boundary conditions. Cross-platform testing ensures consistent performance across different devices and interfaces.

## Business User Testing

Subject matter experts and representative end users validate the chatbot against real-world business requirements. Domain experts verify technical accuracy and industry-specific knowledge, while product owners ensure alignment with business objectives. This validation process includes testing primary user workflows, reviewing content accuracy for brand voice consistency, and collecting systematic feedback for continuous improvement. Acceptance criteria testing confirms the chatbot meets defined success metrics and user stories.

## Automated Evaluation with DeepEval

DeepEval provides continuous automated assessment using key metrics including faithfulness, answer relevancy, contextual recall, and bias detection. The framework measures factual accuracy, response appropriateness, and harmful content detection across standardized test datasets. Automated evaluations run on scheduled intervals to track performance over time, enabling A/B testing of model versions and real-time monitoring of production conversations. This ensures consistent quality without manual intervention.

## Integrated Testing Workflow

Our testing pipeline follows a structured approach: automated evaluations first identify potential issues, followed by manual testing to validate user experience, and finally business stakeholder sign-off. Success criteria include automated metrics above defined thresholds (faithfulness >0.8, answer relevancy >0.7), 90% pass rate on manual test cases, and business validation approval. Risk mitigation includes fallback mechanisms for edge cases, human oversight for sensitive topics, and continuous monitoring with automated alerts for performance degradation.

## Success Metrics & Tools

We measure success through response quality scores, user satisfaction ratings, and achievement of business KPIs. Our toolset combines DeepEval for automated evaluation, structured manual testing protocols, and business feedback collection systems. This comprehensive approach ensures our AI chatbot delivers accurate, relevant, and business-aligned responses while maintaining high user satisfaction and operational reliability.
