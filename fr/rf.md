Great observation — **rules management** is often a pain point in legacy fraud systems, and poor governance here can lead to:

* **Rule duplication**
* **Inconsistent logic**
* **Difficult debugging**
* **Slow time-to-value for new fraud types**

For your RFP, it’s critical to probe the **capabilities, governance, and usability of the rule management system** in the new solution.
