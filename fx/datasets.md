### Key Points
- Research suggests several datasets are suitable for machine learning in foreign exchange, including historical rates and high-frequency data.
- It seems likely that Kaggle, HistData.com, GitHub, Myfxbook, and Dukascopy offer reliable forex datasets for analysis.
- The evidence leans toward these datasets being widely used, but availability and quality may vary.

### Overview
Foreign exchange (forex) data is crucial for machine learning applications in banking, such as predicting currency movements or optimizing trading strategies. Below, we highlight some key datasets that are accessible and suitable for these purposes, along with their sources and descriptions.

### Recommended Datasets
Here are some datasets that researchers and practitioners often use for forex-related machine learning:

- **Currency Exchange Rates on Kaggle**: This dataset, available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thebasss/currency-exchange-rates), includes daily rates from the International Monetary Fund for 51 currencies from 1995 to 2018, ideal for time series analysis.
- **Free Forex Data from HistData.com**: Accessible at [HistData.com](http://www.histdata.com/download-free-forex-data/), this offers 1-minute bar data for various forex pairs, suitable for high-frequency trading models.
- **FX-1-Minute-Data on GitHub**: Found at [GitHub](https://github.com/philipperemy/FX-1-Minute-Data), this repository provides 1-minute data for multiple forex pairs, updated regularly for advanced analysis.
- **Historical Forex Data from Myfxbook**: Available at [Myfxbook](https://www.myfxbook.com/forex-market/historical-data), it offers data across multiple timeframes, useful for backtesting and predictive modeling.
- **Historical Data Feed from Dukascopy**: Accessible at [Dukascopy](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/), this includes forex and other financial instruments, supporting comprehensive market analysis.

These datasets provide a solid foundation for machine learning tasks, but users should verify data quality and compatibility with their specific needs.
