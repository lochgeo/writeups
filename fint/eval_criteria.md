### Scoring Mechanism:
- Each criterion is scored from 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest.
- Multiply the score by the weight assigned to each criterion to get the weighted score.
- Sum the weighted scores to get the total evaluation score.
- **Total Score = Σ (Score * Weight)**

### Evaluation Interpretation:
- **90-100:** Strong candidate for partnership and integration.
- **75-89:** Good potential but may require some adjustments or further evaluation.
- **50-74:** Needs significant improvements or has notable risks.
- **Below 50:** Not a suitable candidate at this time.
